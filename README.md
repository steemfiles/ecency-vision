### Build instructions

##### Requirements

- node ^12.0.0
- yarn

##### Clone 
`$ git clone https://github.com/ecency/ecency-vision`

`$ cd ecency-vision`

##### Install dependencies
`$ yarn`

##### Edit backend config file or define environment variables
`$ nano src/config.ts`

##### Environment variables

* `USE_PRIVATE` -  if instance has private api address and auth (0 or 1 value)
* `PRIVATE_API_ADDR` - private api endpoint
* `PRIVATE_API_AUTH` - private api auth
* `HIVESIGNER_CLIENT_SECRET` -  hivesigner client secret
* `SEARCH_API_ADDR` - hivesearcher api endpoint
* `SEARCH_API_SECRET` - hivesearcher api auth token

###### USE_PRIVATE

You should set this to '0' unless you're part of the ecency team.

###### PRIVATE_API_ADDR
Should be a full address with protocol and port

###### PRIVATE_API_AUTH
This is generated with the following steps.  Take a string and
make it a JSON object.
Example:
```
> s=JSON.stringify(0xF00);
'3840'
> (Buffer.from('3840', 'utf-8')).toString('base64')
'Mzg0MA=='
```
Now 'Mzg0MA==' should work.  The object passed in should be a long hexadecimal number.

###### SEARCH_API_ADDR and SEARCH_API_SECRET

You need to sign up at HiveSearcher and get a secret there.  The Hive Searcher URL is https://api.hivesearcher.com/. 


###### HIVE_SIGNER_CLIENT_SECRET

You need to sign up with a Hive account at [Hive Signer](https://hivesigner.com/developers). 
You'll get an APP_SECRET there for that account and you'll
need to add the account name to the common config file.


##### Create Common Config File 
`$ cp src/client_config_default.js src/client_config.ts`
`$ nano src/client_config.ts`

###### HIVE_SIGNER_APP

As the corresponding constant to HIVE_SIGNER_CLIENT_SECRET,
this should be set to the account username you have at Hive Signer.  Do not use the '@' sign in the username.

##### Start website in dev
`$ yarn start`

For website development Change ```HIVE_SIGNER_APP``` in ```src/client_config.ts``` to an account that you control.  This account must have it's APP_SECRET with Hive Signer. This environment variable ```HIVESIGNER_CLIENT_SECRET``` must be set  to this secret.  Additionally, @hivesigner must be given posting authority for said account.  If that HIVE_SIGNER_APP happens to be 'ecency.app', then you'll need the APP_SECRET that corresponds to that app.


##### Start desktop in dev
`$ cd src/desktop`
`$ yarn`
`$ yarn dev`

For *desktop* development you should set the ```HIVE_SIGNER_APP``` to ```'ecency.app'``` if you wish that it uses Hive,
and Ecency points.

##### Pushing new code / Pull requests

- Make sure to branch off your changes from `development` branch.
- Make sure to run `yarn test` and add tests to your changes.
- Code on!

## Docker

You can use official `ecency/vision:latest` image to run Vision locally, deploy it to staging or even production environment. The simplest way is to run it with following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 ecency/vision:latest
```

Configure the instance using following environment variables:
 * `USE_PRIVATE`
 * `PRIVATE_API_ADDR`
 * `PRIVATE_API_AUTH`
 * `HIVESIGNER_CLIENT_SECRET`
 * `SEARCH_API_ADDR`
 * `SEARCH_API_SECRET`

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -e PRIVATE_API_ADDR=https://api.example.com -e PRIVATE_API_AUTH=verysecretpassword ecency/vision:latest
```

### Swarm

You can easily deploy a set of vision instances to your production environment, using example `docker-compose.yml` file. Docker Swarm will automatically keep it alive and load balance incoming traffic between the containers:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.production.yml vision
```
